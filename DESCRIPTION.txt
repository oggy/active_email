Adds a thin abstraction on top of ActionMailer, which provides AR-like email models (with validations, callbacks, associations, protection from mass-assignment, etc.).  This allows your email actions to flow much the same as ActiveRecord ones.  On the testing side, ActiveEmail provides EmailRat, a Webrat-like agent for receiving email, for integration testing.
